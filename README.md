<h2>USE THIS BRANCH ON YOUR RISK, I HAVE ADDED FILE-RENAMING IN TORRENT, MAGNET AND AUTO-DETECT FUNCTIONS IN THIS BRANCH</h2>
<h3>Now this have different file splitter that creates multipart/spanned zip files, but when the file is splitting wont accept any cmd, tho will work out till end, no issues if not downloading 2GB+ files</h3>
<h3>Now this also have auto rename feature based on regex custom made on someone's request, it just remove stuff between brackets in torrent file name</h3>
<pre>
/filetorrent link | newFileName
/torrent link | newFileName
/ziptorrent link | newFileName
/magnet link | newFileName
/filemagnet link | newFileName
/zipmagnet link | newFileName
link | newFileName (auto detects)
</pre><br>
<h3>Note: I have added serialize renaming for torrents with multiple files</h3>
<pre>
You just need to add {p or P or s or S, any number (optional)} at the end of newFileName
like

/filetorrent link | newFileName {p,3}

well
p/P = prefix
s/S = suffix
and the number stated is range of digits for serialization
default is 3
Thus,

/filetorrent link | test.mkv {p,2} gives
01 test.mkv
02 test.mkv
03 test.mkv
04 test.mkv

/filetorrent link | test.mkv {s,4} gives
test 0001.mkv
test 0002.mkv
test 0003.mkv
test 0004.mkv

/filetorrent link | test.mkv {p} gives
001 test.mkv
002 test.mkv
003 test.mkv
004 test.mkv
</pre>
